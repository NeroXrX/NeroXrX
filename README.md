## 🔍 About Me

I'm focused on building strong offensive security skills by working through homelabs, real-world vulnerable machines, and capture-the-flag challenges. Every project I take on helps me grow in ethical hacking, enumeration, and exploitation techniques.

Currently diving deep into:
- 🕸️ Web Application Pentesting
- 🔍 Recon & Exploitation
- 📂 Homelab setups and vulnerable machine analysis
- 🛠️ Tool development (mostly in Bash and python)
